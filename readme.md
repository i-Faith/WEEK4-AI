#### AI Assignment 
- üìå Overview
This project is part of an AI coursework assignment that involves building and evaluating machine learning models for predictive analytics.
The focus is on predicting breast cancer using the popular Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, while also exploring theoretical knowledge and ethical considerations of AI in software engineering.

‚úÖ Part 1: Theoretical Understanding
Topics Covered:
TensorFlow vs PyTorch: Compared based on ease of use, flexibility, and community support.

Jupyter Notebooks: Explained as tools for interactive, iterative coding in data science.

spaCy for NLP: Described its role in Named Entity Recognition and text analysis.

üß™ Part 2: Practical Implementation
1. Scikit-learn with the Iris Dataset
Built a simple classification model using LogisticRegression from sklearn.

Evaluated model using accuracy and confusion matrix.

2. CNN on MNIST Dataset
Used TensorFlow to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Achieved high accuracy in handwritten digit recognition.

3. spaCy on Amazon Reviews
Performed Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy.

Extracted named entities from customer reviews.

4. AI-powered Code Completion
Compared human-written and Copilot-suggested code for sorting.

Highlighted benefits of AI in improving developer efficiency.

5. AI-Powered Testing with Selenium
Wrote a test automation script for a login page using Selenium WebDriver.

Included both valid and invalid login tests with assertions.

6. Predictive Analytics (Breast Cancer Dataset)
Built a classification model using RandomForestClassifier on the breast cancer dataset.

Evaluated model using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

‚öñÔ∏è Part 3: Ethical Reflection
Potential Biases:
Lack of demographic diversity in the dataset.

Possible class imbalance affecting prediction performance.

Risk of biased predictions in real-world applications.

Fairness Tools:
IBM AI Fairness 360 suggested for:

Detecting and visualizing bias.

Applying pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing mitigation techniques.
